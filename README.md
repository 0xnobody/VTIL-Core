# VTIL

## 1) What is VTIL?
VTIL (Virtual-machine Translation Intermediate Language) Project is a set of tools that can be used for binary deobfuscation and devirtualization.

## 2) What is this repostiory?

This repository contains the core components of the VTIL project we use across the VTIL toolchain.
It is likely incomplete as initial release is not done yet, and documentation and FAQ will be within this repository and the organization website once they're done.

Until the initial release you can keep up to date with the VTIL project by checking my [personal twitter account](https://twitter.com/_can1357) or the VTIL website [vtil.org](https://vtil.org/).
